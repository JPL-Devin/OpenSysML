## Unreleased

### Language and semantics

- A requirement or constraint condition is evaluated against the features of the
  element stating it, so it sees that element's own attributes, the ones it
  inherits from the definition it is typed by, and the values a usage rebinds
  (`attribute :>> maxVerticalSpeed = 1.5;`, `constraint limit : MassLimit { in m = mass; }`).
  This was the first known limitation listed for 0.0.4.
- `require <expr>;` and `assume <expr>;` parse in a requirement definition body,
  not only in a usage, as do the `concern def`, `viewpoint def` and
  `satisfy … by …` bodies that share the member set. A `subject` may redeclare
  the one it inherits (`subject subj : View[1] :>> RequirementCheck::subj;`).
- A condition stated through a nested constraint — `require constraint { <expr> }`,
  `assert constraint [name] { <expr> }` — is evaluated, with every condition of
  that body kept rather than only the last. A requirement carrying no condition
  still has no verdict rather than passing vacuously.
- A violated condition reports which condition failed
  (`Required condition evaluated to false: actualVerticalSpeed <= maxVerticalSpeed`),
  and a feature a condition names but which holds no value is reported as such
  rather than as unresolved.
- `assert satisfy <requirement> by <part>;` has a verdict of its own: the
  assertion is evaluated as the requirement usage it is, with the requirement's
  subject parameter bound to an object of the part named by `by`, so the
  requirement's conditions — its own and the ones it inherits — read that
  object's values. A requirement feature carrying no value of its own is read
  from that object's feature of the same name, as it is when a requirement is
  evaluated on an instance.
- `%satisfy` evaluates the satisfaction assertions a model states — every one, or
  the ones a named element states — since `assert satisfy … by …` is anonymous
  and could not be named at the prompt before.
- An assertion can be negated: `assert not constraint { <expr> }` and
  `assert not satisfy <requirement> by <part>;` hold exactly when the conditions
  they deny do not, rather than parsing as a declaration named `not`. A negation
  denies the conditions of the constraint it is written on together — `not (a and
  b)`, not `not a and not b` — so it holds as soon as one of them fails.
- The KerML function library's scalar numeric functions are evaluable: `sqrt`,
  `abs`, `floor`, `round`, `max`, `min`, `isZero`, `isUnit`, `sin`, `cos`, `tan`,
  `cot`, `arcsin`, `arccos` and `arctan`. Dispatch is by the declaration's
  qualified name, so a model's own `calc sqrt` is evaluated from its body.
- Exponentiation (`**`, `^`) is evaluated, by one implementation the constant
  folder and the runtime share. Integer operands with a non-negative exponent
  give an Integer, any other numeric pair a Real.
- `exp`, `ln`, `log(x, base)` and `atan2(y, x)` are evaluable. The OMG Kernel
  Function Library declares no signature for any of them, so they are declared in
  a new non-normative Systemica extension library,
  `internal/core/libs/stdlib/Systemica Libraries/SystemicaMathFunctions.kerml`,
  which a model reaches with `import SystemicaMathFunctions::*;`. The vendored OMG
  files are unchanged; the stdlib parse gate is now 95/95 clean.
- A result that is not a finite value of the declared type — `sqrt(-1.0)`,
  `arcsin(2.0)`, `ln(0.0)`, `log(x, 1.0)`, `atan2(0.0, 0.0)`, `0.0 ** -1.0`,
  integer overflow — is reported where the expression is evaluated instead of
  folding to a NaN, an infinity or a wrapped integer.

### Runtime and tooling

- A parser try-parse that gives up now rewinds: the token buffer is read through
  a cursor rather than re-sliced as tokens are consumed, so a checkpoint restores
  the position it was taken at, along with the diagnostics and warnings the
  abandoned attempt reported. Backtracking previously left the words the attempt
  had consumed behind, which made a condition beginning with a feature named
  `constraint` (`assert constraint x > 0;`) report a missing expression it did
  have, and could exceed the buffer's capacity. A reserved word used as a name
  in an expression still does not resolve; that is a separate gap.
- `redefines <target> = <value>` is read whatever the target's length: the member
  is recognized by parsing the target and rewinding when no `=` follows, in place
  of a scan capped at ten tokens ahead that read
  `redefines outer.middle.inner.leaf.deeper.deepest.last = 1;` as a body member
  it could not parse.
- The evaluation step budget is configurable through `SYSML_MAX_STEPS`, so a
  legitimately long run — a numeric integration in an action body, say — is not
  bounded by a fixed ceiling. A value that is not a positive integer is reported
  at REPL/CLI startup and at gRPC service construction, naming the variable and
  the value, rather than falling back to the default silently.
- The step-limit error reports the budget actually in force and names
  `SYSML_MAX_STEPS`, so the message says how to raise it.
- The three sibling runaway bounds are configurable the same way, each through
  its own variable, since they count incommensurable units: an action run's
  token-flow steps through `SYSML_MAX_ACTION_STEPS`, a state machine run's
  dispatched events through `SYSML_MAX_EVENTS` and its do-activity actions
  through `SYSML_MAX_DO_STEPS`. Each error names the
  variable that raises it, so a long simulation is no longer capped by a bound
  with no way out.
- The defaults are raised to 10 000 000 evaluation steps, 1 000 000 action
  token-flow steps, 1 000 000 events and 5 000 000 do-activity steps (from
  100 000 / 10 000 / 10 000 / 100 000). Execution allocates nothing per step —
  peak RSS is ~34 MB whether a run spends ten thousand steps or fifty million —
  so the sizes are set by how long a runaway takes to report: at ~13.6M
  evaluation steps/s and ~1.9M events/s each reports one within about a second,
  and a fully traced run at all four ceilings holds ~320 MB.
- The evaluation step budget bounds one run rather than a whole session: the
  counter is reset when a run begins - an evaluation, a constraint or
  requirement check, an instantiation, a calc invocation, an action or a state
  machine - so a REPL session of many small evaluations no longer exhausts its
  allowance and starts failing every one. A run started inside another shares
  the outer run's budget, as does every call into a run a caller drives step by
  step (the `%action`/`%state` debuggers), so a runaway cannot escape the bound
  by starting runs of its own.
- The REPL's `%advance` no longer stops after a fixed 10 000 events and
  do-activity actions, which could look like a machine that had settled. It is
  bounded by the session's event and do-activity budgets, and says which one cut
  a drain short.

## 0.0.4 — 2026-08-10

The first tagged release.

### Language and semantics

- Hand-written SysML v2 lexer and recursive-descent parser that never panics:
  malformed input yields error nodes and diagnostics. All 94 official SysML v2
  standard library files parse clean.
- Lazy, memoized name resolution and a type system covering conformance,
  multiplicity, specialization, redefinition and feature chains. An unnamed
  feature takes its effective name from what it redefines or reference-subsets
  (`:>> power = 250.0;` names, and overrides, `power`), and a nested usage that
  reuses an inherited name without redefining it is reported.
- Tiered validation (syntax → name resolution → typing → constraints), where a
  failing tier suppresses the ones above it rather than reporting noise.
- Measured spec compliance, rule by rule, in
  [docs/SPEC_COMPLIANCE.md](docs/SPEC_COMPLIANCE.md); 98/100 of the OMG
  training corpus parses and analyzes clean, with the two remaining files
  pinned as upstream source bugs.

### Execution

- Instantiation materializes objects from part definitions: literal defaults
  are folded, defaults written over sibling features are evaluated against the
  object, and a cyclic default is reported as a cycle rather than exhausting
  the step budget.
- Constraints and requirements are evaluated bound to a concrete instance, so a
  verdict is about an object rather than about a declaration. A false condition
  is a verdict, not an internal error.
- Action execution over lowered graphs: tokens, fork/join/decision/merge,
  control-flow keywords, nested invocation, `send`, and `accept` that suspends
  until its message arrives.
- State machine execution: transitions, guards, entry/do/exit behaviors,
  hierarchy, orthogonal regions, pseudostates including shallow and deep
  history, time and change and call triggers, deferred events.
- Every unsupported path returns a typed error; robustness cases cover
  deadlock, dangling transitions, unbound parameters, and budget exhaustion.

### `sysml` REPL

- Declarations, instantiation and inspection: `%instantiate`, `%slots`,
  `%instances`, `%eval`, `%calc`, `%constraint`, `%requirement`. Every command
  accepts a qualified name, so a model inside a `package` is reachable.
- Action debugging (`%action`, `%step`, `%continue`, `%tokens`, `%break`,
  `%stop`) and state machine debugging (`%state`, `%events`, `%current`,
  `%advance <time>`).
- Output modes: `-quiet` reports errors only, `-debug` widens diagnostics to
  the whole session buffer with absolute positions and originating pass, and
  `-trace` prints the execution trace — evaluation steps, calc invocation,
  token flow, transitions — as commands run. `%verbosity` and `%trace` are the
  prompt equivalents.
- A submission's report covers what was just typed: diagnostics are scoped to
  it and line numbers are relative to it.
- `sysml -e '<expr>'` evaluates without entering the prompt; `--version`
  reports the release tag, commit, build time and Go version.

### Tooling

- `sysml-lsp`, a Language Server Protocol server (diagnostics, hover,
  completion, go-to-definition).
- `sysml-grpc` plus Python bindings (`python/`) for driving parse and execution
  from a notebook, including DataFrame output. `Instantiate` reads slots the way
  the REPL does, so a derived attribute comes back evaluated rather than
  unmaterialized. The service binary is published with the release, so `pysysml`
  can fetch and checksum-verify one instead of requiring a Go toolchain:
  `download_binary('latest')`, or set `PYSYSML_GRPC_VERSION` and let
  `pysysml.connect()` start it.
- Releases publish per-binary and bundle archives, and the raw
  `sysml-grpc-<os>-<arch>` binaries with `.sha256` sidecars, for linux/amd64,
  linux/arm64, darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64 and windows/amd64, with
  `SHA256SUMS.txt` over all of them. macOS and Windows binaries are unsigned —
  see [docs/MACOS_DISTRIBUTION.md](docs/MACOS_DISTRIBUTION.md).

### Known limitations

- A parameter bound by a constraint or requirement usage
  (`constraint limit : MassLimit { in m = mass; }`) is not passed into the
  conditions it inherits from its definition. *(Fixed after this release; see
  the Unreleased section.)*
- A multi-valued feature that is both typed and given a default takes the typed
  instantiation; the default is not merged into it.
