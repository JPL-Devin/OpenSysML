# Changelog

Notable changes per release. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Cutting a release
is described in [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md).

## Unreleased

### Language and semantics

- The KerML function library's scalar numeric functions are evaluable: `sqrt`,
  `abs`, `floor`, `round`, `max`, `min`, `isZero`, `isUnit`, `sin`, `cos`, `tan`,
  `cot`, `arcsin`, `arccos` and `arctan`. Dispatch is by the declaration's
  qualified name, so a model's own `calc sqrt` is evaluated from its body.
- Exponentiation (`**`, `^`) is evaluated, by one implementation the constant
  folder and the runtime share. Integer operands with a non-negative exponent
  give an Integer, any other numeric pair a Real.
- A result that is not a finite value of the declared type — `sqrt(-1.0)`,
  `arcsin(2.0)`, `0.0 ** -1.0`, integer overflow — is reported where the
  expression is evaluated instead of folding to a NaN, an infinity or a wrapped
  integer.

## 0.0.4 — 2026-08-10

The first tagged release.

### Language and semantics

- Hand-written SysML v2 lexer and recursive-descent parser that never panics:
  malformed input yields error nodes and diagnostics. All 94 official SysML v2
  standard library files parse clean.
- Lazy, memoized name resolution and a type system covering conformance,
  multiplicity, specialization, redefinition and feature chains. An unnamed
  feature takes its effective name from what it redefines or reference-subsets
  (`:>> power = 250.0;` names, and overrides, `power`), and a nested usage that
  reuses an inherited name without redefining it is reported.
- Tiered validation (syntax → name resolution → typing → constraints), where a
  failing tier suppresses the ones above it rather than reporting noise.
- Measured spec compliance, rule by rule, in
  [docs/SPEC_COMPLIANCE.md](docs/SPEC_COMPLIANCE.md); 98/100 of the OMG
  training corpus parses and analyzes clean, with the two remaining files
  pinned as upstream source bugs.

### Execution

- Instantiation materializes objects from part definitions: literal defaults
  are folded, defaults written over sibling features are evaluated against the
  object, and a cyclic default is reported as a cycle rather than exhausting
  the step budget.
- Constraints and requirements are evaluated bound to a concrete instance, so a
  verdict is about an object rather than about a declaration. A false condition
  is a verdict, not an internal error.
- Action execution over lowered graphs: tokens, fork/join/decision/merge,
  control-flow keywords, nested invocation, `send`, and `accept` that suspends
  until its message arrives.
- State machine execution: transitions, guards, entry/do/exit behaviors,
  hierarchy, orthogonal regions, pseudostates including shallow and deep
  history, time and change and call triggers, deferred events.
- Every unsupported path returns a typed error; robustness cases cover
  deadlock, dangling transitions, unbound parameters, and budget exhaustion.

### `sysml` REPL

- Declarations, instantiation and inspection: `%instantiate`, `%slots`,
  `%instances`, `%eval`, `%calc`, `%constraint`, `%requirement`. Every command
  accepts a qualified name, so a model inside a `package` is reachable.
- Action debugging (`%action`, `%step`, `%continue`, `%tokens`, `%break`,
  `%stop`) and state machine debugging (`%state`, `%events`, `%current`,
  `%advance <time>`).
- Output modes: `-quiet` reports errors only, `-debug` widens diagnostics to
  the whole session buffer with absolute positions and originating pass, and
  `-trace` prints the execution trace — evaluation steps, calc invocation,
  token flow, transitions — as commands run. `%verbosity` and `%trace` are the
  prompt equivalents.
- A submission's report covers what was just typed: diagnostics are scoped to
  it and line numbers are relative to it.
- `sysml -e '<expr>'` evaluates without entering the prompt; `--version`
  reports the release tag, commit, build time and Go version.

### Tooling

- `sysml-lsp`, a Language Server Protocol server (diagnostics, hover,
  completion, go-to-definition).
- `sysml-grpc` plus Python bindings (`python/`) for driving parse and execution
  from a notebook, including DataFrame output. `Instantiate` reads slots the way
  the REPL does, so a derived attribute comes back evaluated rather than
  unmaterialized. The service binary is published with the release, so `pysysml`
  can fetch and checksum-verify one instead of requiring a Go toolchain:
  `download_binary('latest')`, or set `PYSYSML_GRPC_VERSION` and let
  `pysysml.connect()` start it.
- Releases publish per-binary and bundle archives, and the raw
  `sysml-grpc-<os>-<arch>` binaries with `.sha256` sidecars, for linux/amd64,
  linux/arm64, darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64 and windows/amd64, with
  `SHA256SUMS.txt` over all of them. macOS and Windows binaries are unsigned —
  see [docs/MACOS_DISTRIBUTION.md](docs/MACOS_DISTRIBUTION.md).

### Known limitations

- A parameter bound by a constraint or requirement usage
  (`constraint limit : MassLimit { in m = mass; }`) is not passed into the
  conditions it inherits from its definition.
- A multi-valued feature that is both typed and given a default takes the typed
  instantiation; the default is not merged into it.
