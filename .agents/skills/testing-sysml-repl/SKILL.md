# Testing the `sysml` REPL end-to-end

The REPL is the user-facing surface of `cmd/sysml`. Test it by actually running the binary, not
just via `go test ./internal/repl`.

## Build

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH   # the repo blueprint puts Go here
make build-sysml                      # -> ./bin/sysml
./bin/sysml --version                 # prints the commit it was built from — useful evidence on camera
```

Always rebuild after pulling a new commit; a stale `bin/sysml` silently tests the old revision.
Print `--version` at the start of a recording so the reviewer can see which commit ran.

## Two ways to drive it

1. **Non-interactive (fast, for exploration and expected-value discovery).** The REPL reads a
   script from stdin fine:
   ```bash
   printf '%%load internal/repl/testdata/vehicle_package.sysml\n%%instantiate Vehicle\n%%slots Demo::Vehicle\n%%quit\n' | timeout 30 ./bin/sysml
   ```
   Note `%%` in `printf` format strings. Always wrap in `timeout` so a hang shows up as a
   non-zero exit rather than stalling the session.
2. **Interactive in a GUI terminal (for the recording).** Because the app under test *is* a CLI,
   the recording should show a real terminal session. See the recording setup below.

## Fixtures worth knowing

- `internal/repl/testdata/vehicle_package.sysml` — everything nested in `package Demo`
  (`Engine`/`power`, `Vehicle`/`mass`+`engine`, `calc add`, a passing `withinMassLimit` and a
  failing `overMassLimit` constraint, `requirement SafeMass`). Ideal for package-scoped vs
  qualified lookup, and for pass *and* fail constraint paths in one file.
- `internal/repl/testdata/action_debug.sysml` — `Debug::tally` with named nodes
  `start, accumulate, end`, so `%break accumulate` has something to stop at; completes with
  `total = 5`.
- `internal/repl/testdata/state_debug.sysml` — `Debug::Cycle`, timed transitions at +10 and +5.
  Good for a partial-vs-full `%advance` drain: `%advance 5` processes 1 event and leaves 1,
  `%advance 30` processes 2 and reaches `done` at time 15.
- `internal/core/runtime/testdata/conformance/state_orthogonal_regions.sysml` — `Test::TrafficLight`
  with two regions; `%current` should print one state per region joined by `|`
  (e.g. `start | start`, then `Walk | Green`), never `<unknown>`.
- Write your own for ambiguity: the same simple name (`part def Vehicle`) in two packages forces
  `error: symbol "Vehicle" is ambiguous: Alpha::Vehicle, Beta::Vehicle (use a qualified name)`.
- Write your own for parse errors (e.g. `attribute mass = ;` plus a missing `}`): the parser never
  panics, so the REPL should print diagnostics and keep accepting commands.

## Things to exercise (and their expected shapes)

- Symbol-taking commands: `%instantiate %slots %eval %calc %constraint %requirement %action %state`.
  All go through one helper (`internal/repl/lookup.go`), so test each with a **simple** name and a
  **qualified** one.
- Instances are keyed by resolved FQN, so `%instantiate Vehicle` then `%slots Demo::Vehicle` must
  hit the same `ID`, and the reverse spelling too. Differing IDs = broken keying.
- Qualified attribute access works with a full FQN (`%eval Demo::Engine::power` → `= 300.00`) but a
  **partial** qualification (`%eval Engine::power`) is `symbol ... not found` — the qualified path
  goes through the index, which wants the whole FQN. Expect this, don't file it as a bug without
  checking intent.
- `%break <node>`: unknown node names are rejected *with the valid node list*; after a stop,
  `%tokens` should print the **node name** (`Token 1 @ accumulate`), not a Go type like `*ast.Usage`.
- `%advance` arguments: `abc` → invalid-time error, `-5` → must-not-be-negative, no arg → `usage:`,
  `0` still drains events already due, a huge value → `No pending work` (must not hang).
  Note the summary line says `Advanced through <deadline>` while `Time:` shows the real clock, so
  `Advanced through 5.00` next to `Time: 0.00` is expected, not a bug.
- Error paths that must never panic: unloaded session (`no declarations loaded`), debugger commands
  with no active session, wrong-kind symbols (`%action` on a part def → `is not an action`),
  nonexistent names, and malformed qualified names (`Demo::`, `::Vehicle`, `Demo::::Vehicle`).

## Session-accumulation trap (bites both testers and features)

`Session.accept` (internal/repl/session.go) drops any earlier snippet whose **declared names**
intersect the new submission's. So typing `package Demo { part def Trailer { ... } }` to *add* a
member to an already-loaded `package Demo` **replaces the whole package** — `Demo::Vehicle` and
friends become `symbol ... not found`, while `%instances` still lists the now-orphaned instance and
instance IDs restart (two live instances can both report `ID: 1`). When you just want to add
declarations mid-session, use a **different package name**. When you want to prove that
newly-typed declarations are visible to the qualified-name path (the `s.idx`/`s.rtCtx`
invalidation in `Submit`), a fresh package avoids conflating the two behaviors.

Also: every submission re-reports diagnostics for the whole accumulated buffer, so one bad snippet
(e.g. accidentally typing a shell command like `clear` at the `>` prompt) keeps re-printing its
error on later submissions. `%clear` resets the session.

## Recording setup (Linux/Plasma box)

The GUI is on `DISPLAY=:0` (`:1` does not exist here — `wmctrl` will say "Cannot open display").

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/repos/Systemica && (DISPLAY=:0 konsole --hide-menubar >/dev/null 2>&1 &)
DISPLAY=:0 wmctrl -a "Konsole"
DISPLAY=:0 wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b add,maximized_vert,maximized_horz
```

Enlarge the font before recording with the `ctrl+plus` key combo a few times (`ctrl+shift+plus`
types literal `+` characters into the shell instead of zooming). Discover expected values with the
piped-stdin form *before* recording, so the recorded run is one clean pass; anything only verified
over a pipe is not visible in the video and should be reported as weaker evidence.
