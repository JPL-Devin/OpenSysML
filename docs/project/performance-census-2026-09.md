# Performance census, September 2026

A measurement of where the toolchain stands after the past week of changes:
week-over-week benchmark movement, and whole-binary scaling against the
figures recorded in `docs/internals/performance.md`.

All figures were taken on one machine — `Intel Xeon Platinum 8559C`, 8 CPUs,
Go 1.25, Linux — the same processor family the figures in
`docs/internals/performance.md` were taken on, so the two sets compare
directly. Treat absolute numbers as ratios elsewhere.

## Week over week: `main` against `main` seven days earlier

`go test ./internal/repl -run '^$' -bench . -benchmem -count 6`, compared with
`benchstat`. The baseline is the merge at the top of `main` seven days before
the measurement (`01b2b86d`, 2026-08-25); the measured revision is `3e5bacb7`.
The benchmark's synthetic model changed between the two revisions — the
notation it used was removed from the grammar in the interval — so the two
sides load equivalent but not byte-identical models; the run benchmarks
(state machine, calc, instantiate) also execute under a runtime whose
completion semantics changed in the same interval.

What moved, with `benchstat` confidence (p ≤ 0.004 unless marked):

| figure | 2026-08-25 | 2026-09-01 | movement |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| load wall, 250/1000/4000 elements | 16.8 / 66.8 / 277 ms | 19.4 / 77.9 / 291 ms | +15% / +17% / +5% |
| load live heap, 250/1000/4000 | 2.49 / 9.77 / 39.0 MiB | 2.15 / 8.26 / 32.8 MiB | −14% / −16% / −16% |
| load allocations, 250/1000/4000 | 124k / 486k / 1.94M | 88k / 341k / 1.35M | −29% / −30% / −30% |
| empty-session load wall | 162 µs | 1024 µs | +532% |
| empty-session bytes allocated | 111 KiB | 695 KiB | +525% |
| state-machine start, 4000 elements | 158 µs | 221 µs | +40% |
| state-machine start bytes/allocs | 5.3 KiB / 81 | 9.0 KiB / 120 | +71% / +48% |
| diagnostics benchmarks | — | — | unchanged |

Loading holds noticeably less and allocates far fewer objects than a week ago,
at a modest wall-time cost at small sizes that fades by 4 000 elements. Two
movements deserve attention:

- **The empty-session floor grew six-fold.** A heap profile attributes the
  growth to `semantics.(*Model).collectAboutAnnotations`: building the
  `about`-metadata index walks every document in the index — the bundled
  standard library included — once per session, and the visited-symbol set for
  that walk is most of the new allocation. The cost is fixed per session
  (~0.9 ms, ~580 KiB of garbage; live heap is unchanged at 32 KiB), so a large
  model amortizes it, but a process serving many short sessions pays it each
  time. Restricting the walk to workspace documents unless the library itself
  declares `about` usages — a fact computable once when the library index is
  built — would restore the old floor.
- **Starting a state machine costs 40% more wall and 71% more memory** than a
  week ago at 4 000 elements. The interval removed the final-state marker in
  favor of completing on a transition to `done` and rewrote the benchmark's
  machine into standard notation, so the two sides execute different models;
  the movement is explained rather than adjudicated here, and the new figures
  are the baseline to watch.

## Whole-binary scaling

`sysml -validate` over generated compliant models in standard notation that
report nothing, three runs each. The documented figures are the table in
`docs/internals/performance.md`.

| elements | documented | measured, this census | peak RSS documented / measured |
| -------- | ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 3 000    | 0.30 s     | 0.33 s                | 117 / ~120 MiB                 |
| 6 000    | 0.49 s     | 0.55–0.61 s           | 159 / ~180 MiB                 |
| 12 000   | 0.92 s     | 1.04 s                | 272 / ~285 MiB                 |

Both time and memory remain linear in the model. The measured points sit
5–12% above the documented ones and the seven-day-old binary measures the
same within noise, so the drift against the documented table predates this
week and is within machine-to-machine variation.

## Batch validation of many files is quadratic

The OMG training corpus — 100 compliant files, 572 KiB — validated as one
batch is the many-small-files shape rather than the one-large-model shape,
and it costs 6.7 s at 168 MiB peak, while its two halves cost 0.6 s and
3.4 s separately — the whole costs far more than its parts. Per-file, every
file is fast alone (the slowest is 0.33 s). A CPU profile of the batch shows
where the time goes: the CLI submits files to the session one at a time, and
every submission reindexes the workspace
(`model.(*Workspace).setOpenBuffer` → `reindexLocked`, 52% of the profile),
re-running `symbols.(*Index).ExpandWildcardImports` over every document
loaded so far — so a batch of *n* files expands wildcard imports *n* times
over a growing buffer, and the total is quadratic in the file count.

This is not a regression — the seven-day-old binary measures the same — and
the cost is in the submission loop rather than in analysis itself.
Submitting a `-validate` batch as one indexing unit, or expanding wildcard
imports incrementally for documents the new submission cannot affect, would
make the corpus cost what its parts cost.

## Assessment

Single-model validation remains linear in both time and memory through
12 000 elements, loading holds less live heap and allocates a third fewer
objects than a week ago, and the two costs worth acting on are internal and
localized: the per-session `about`-metadata walk that grew the empty-session
floor, and the quadratic submission loop in many-file batch validation.
