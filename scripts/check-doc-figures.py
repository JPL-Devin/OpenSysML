"""Fail when a page quotes an oracle figure without saying which round it measured.

The oracle totals move whenever a rule, a fixture or the pin does, and the only
statement of the current ones is the ``doc-counts`` generated block, regenerated
from the committed baselines. Every other mention is a snapshot of the round that
wrote it, so a page carrying one has to say so — otherwise a reader takes a figure
from an engineering record as current, which is the drift this check exists to
prevent.

A page passes when either no figure outside a generated block is quoted, or the
disclaimer phrase is present. Run via ``make docs-check``.
