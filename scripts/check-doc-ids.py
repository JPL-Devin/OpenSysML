"""Fail when reader-facing documentation cites an internal work-item label.

Waves, follow-up rows (F<n>), adjudication probes (P<n>) and diagnostic classes
(K<n>/S<n>) are this project's own bookkeeping: they have no public referent, so
a reader cannot resolve them. The deep conformance records under docs/project/
may use them — they define them and cross-reference each other by them — but the
handbook, the reference, the architecture pages and the changelog must say what
the behaviour or the decision was instead.

Run from the repository root:
